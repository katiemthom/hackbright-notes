Grand Unified Theory
--------------------

1. Identify all nouns.
2. Crapify the nouns.
3. Widget
4. View

Step 1, detailed:
----------------- 

Nouns
-----
users (have many comments, have many posts)
comments (belongs to post, has user)
posts (belongs to user, has many comments) 

Diagram who belongs to who. 
Each noun becomes a table
Then you define relationships with edges: has one, has many, belongs to, has many and belongs to many 
So then we figure out what goes in each table. 

Step 2, detailed: 
-----------------

CREATE (make)
RECOUNT (list)
AMEND (change)
PRINT (show)

You basically need one function to handle each of these things.
This usually translates to one controller. 

Step 3, detailed: 
-----------------

The widget is the noun that is the most important thing.

Step 4: 
-------

Design around that.
