<html>
	<head> <!--style tells the browser we are using css to style our page-->
		<style type="text/css"> 
			h1 { 
				font-family: arial;
			}
			#im_a_box {
				color: red; 
			}
			.la {
				background-color: yellow; 
			}
		</style>
		<!-- above we make the heading a different font that's how you style a tag like h1 -->
		<!-- above we make div "im_a_box" text red, style ids like im_a_box with # -->
		<!-- above we make div "la" have a background color of yellow, style classes like la with . -->
		<!-- use classes for many things, ids for one thing -->
		<!-- e.g. class: text id: body_text -->
		<!-- basically, ids are more specific -->
		<!-- an element can have many classes, but only one id -->
		<!-- usually we don't put css in the html file, usually we put it in another file --> 
	</head>
	<body>
	<!-- This is a comment -->
	<!-- The body is where you put your content!-->
		<h1> <!-- h1 => header 1 -->
