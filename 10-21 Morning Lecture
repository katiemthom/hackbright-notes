//In JavaScript, always assign variables to a value.

//e.g. Don't do this: 

var b; 

//Do this: 

var b = 'something!';

//Now we're talking about sessions.

//Going into flask...

from flask import Flask, session, render_template
import random

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def index():
	number = random.randint(0,100)
	return "Hello unknown person, here is your number %d" % number

if __name__ == "__main__": 
	app.run(debug = True)

//Everytime you refresh, you get a new number.

//A session is a dictionary. 
//Here we add the session.

from flask import Flask, session, render_template
import random

app = Flask(__name__)
app.secret_key = "This is not a secret"

@app.route("/")
def index():
	number = session.get("number")
	if number is None: 
		number = random.randint(0,100)
		session['number'] = number 
	return "Hello unknown person, here is your number %d" % number

if __name__ == "__main__": 
	app.run(debug = True)

//Now the number doesn't change! 

//Long explanation of sessions where I stopped taking notes
//because I was confused. :(

//Browser stores encrypted session and shows it to the server
//when it makes a request to the server.
//An example of making a request: 
//On facebook, I'm logged in and I want to see my wall.
//Request: click wall and tell server "oh by the way I'm 
//Katie" but it doesn't actually say Katie it says the
//encrypted version

//The secret key encrypts and decrypts the session.
//What you save the secret key as doesn't matter much.
