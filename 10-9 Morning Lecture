## -----------databases------------------

## a database lets you save things to a harddrive 

## a database is a list of lists

## so why don't we save it to a file? 

## can organize data to make searching faster 

## SQLite does this for you!

## SQL = structured query language

## -----------e.g.-----------------------

## e.g. employees: database

> insert into employees values(1, "Christian", "Fernandez", "c@hackbrightacademy.com")

## show tables

> . tables 
employees 

> .schema employees

> .mode columns

## show entries 

> select * from employees;

> insert into employees (first_name, last_name, email) values ("Liz", "Howard", "liz@hackbrightacademy.com");

> select first_name from employees;

> select first_name, id from employees;

## select = show me
> select first_name from employees where id=1; 

> select first_name from employees where id < 3; 

## id = primary key

## ------------------joining-------------

## what is a relational database? 

> select employee_id, first_name, murder_victim, hit_cost from dark_secrets inner join employees on employee_id=employees.id; 

## what is inner join--selects only matching records 

> update employees set first_name="C-Dawg" where id=1; 

## ---------------delete-----------------

> delete from employees where id > 1;

## CAREFUL! SELECT FIRST to make sure they are the rows you want!

## --------------exercise----------------

## launch 

> sqlite3

## mash w/ python by writing queries as strings 

## db.execute(insert...)

## database engine --> mySQL, etc. (also called database)

## database --> file that holds data

## ---------------mentors----------------

## try to meet once a week with mentors (higher-level)

## use senior software engineers during projects 

## keep in touch via email at least once a week

## schedule around their schedule, be sure you have something to talk about once you meet

## meet at their office a few times but have them come here also 

## share your github and twitter with them
