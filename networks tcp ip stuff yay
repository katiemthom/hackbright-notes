networks tcp ip stuff yay
-------------------------

structure
---------
operating system(python(program/app)) = interface_connection 
										-> network port 
										-> physical layer (wire) 
										-> internet/LAN/whatever

side note
---------
flask made a listener socket 

some vocab
----------
port
host -> the server that you're talking to (really an ip address)
server: any machine that is listening for a request, and when 
a request comes in, it serves a response 

protocols
---------
tcp - transmission control protocol
ip - internet protocol 
ethernet protocol lets you talk over the wire 
tcp/ip makes the internet exchange of data work
web servers use http 
dns
email
chat

commands
--------
$ host google.com
host: dns lookup
$ ping google.com
$ traceroute google.com


tcp/ip protocol
---------------
you have an ip address and a port 
the port defines what application your program talks to
port 80: http
port 25: email
port 23: dns

What did you mean by dns lookup? (host command)
-----------------------------------------------
dns domain name servie the method from going from domain name to number

How do we make a server?
------------------------
python has a library called socket
we can use it to make connections to sockets
