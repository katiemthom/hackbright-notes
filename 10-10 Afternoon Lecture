mesh networds

inspired by:
	project loon - balloon powered internet by Google!

vocab:
	- topology: how a network is laid out
	- amy is talking about mesh networds
	- node: connection point
	- redundancy: if one node fails, the network can still communicate
	- link: connects the nodes together (can be cable or wireless) 
	- in a mesh netword every node is connected to every other node 
	- that's called a full mesh
	- partial meshes...are partially like that (maybe one or two nodes aren't conntected to every other node, they're less expensive)

wired vs unwired: 
	- wireless mesh network (like project loon)
	- there is a source where the connection comes from
	- balloons are nodes
	- each house has an antenna that talks to the closest balloon node to get a connection
	- the loons are higher in the air than planes are!

questions:
	- project loon is being piloted in new zealand
	- the goal is to provide internet to remote places
	- speed is described as similar to a 3g network
	- probably can't see them from the ground

liz asks how html/css is going

liz wants to talk about the box model 

when you say float left:
	- browser starts stacking the elements
	- it starts with the first element and the left hand side of the screen
